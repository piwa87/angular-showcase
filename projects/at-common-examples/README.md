# ATFrontendCommon - Examples

## Running the application

Run `npm run examples` to run the at-common-examples project.

## Adding new examples to the project

- In `src/app` use the CLI to add a new component.
- Then in `src/app/app.routes.ts` add a path to the new component. Doing so will automatically include the new component in the navbar of the application.

## Running unit tests

All unit tests are run from the repository's root folder by: `npm run test`
